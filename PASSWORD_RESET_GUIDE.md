# Password Reset Guide

## How to Change User Passwords

Since passwords are now securely hashed, you **cannot** simply edit the `user_accounts.json` file. Instead, use one of these methods:

---

## Method 1: Interactive Script (Recommended for Admin)

### Run the interactive password reset tool:

```bash
cd StaffSphere1/backend
python reset_password.py
```

### Example Session:

```
============================================================
PASSWORD RESET TOOL
============================================================

============================================================
AVAILABLE USERS
============================================================
  Username: admin
  Full Name: Mrs. Nhung
  Email: nhung@company.com
  Role: Administrator
  --------------------------------------------------------
  Username: hung12
  Full Name: Hung Nguyen
  Email: hung12@gmail.com
  Role: User
  --------------------------------------------------------
============================================================

Enter the username of the user whose password you want to reset:
> hung12

Enter new password for 'hung12':
> mynewpassword

Confirm new password:
> mynewpassword

[WARNING] You are about to reset password for user 'hung12'.
Are you sure? (yes/no):
> yes

[PROCESSING] Resetting password...

============================================================
[SUCCESS] Password successfully reset for user 'hung12'

User 'hung12' can now login with the new password.
============================================================
```

## Method 2: Quick Command-Line (Fastest)

### One-line password reset:

```bash
cd StaffSphere1/backend
python quick_reset_password.py hung12 mynewpassword
```

### Output:
```
Resetting password for user: hung12
[SUCCESS] Password successfully reset for user 'hung12'
User 'hung12' can now login with the new password.
```

---

## Method 3: API Endpoint (For Applications)

### Reset Password (Admin Function)

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/reset-password`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "username": "hung12",
  "new_password": "mynewpassword"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password successfully reset for user 'hung12'",
  "username": "hung12"
}
```

**Example with curl**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3200/api/auth/reset-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"hung12","new_password":"mynewpassword"}'
```

---

## Method 4: Change Own Password (User Function)

### For users to change their own password (requires current password)

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/change-password`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "username": "hung12",
  "old_password": "babykute",
  "new_password": "mynewpassword"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password successfully reset for user 'hung12'",
  "username": "hung12"
}
```

**Example with curl**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3200/api/auth/change-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username":"hung12",
    "old_password":"babykute",
    "new_password":"mynewpassword"
  }'
```

python reset_password.py
# Then follow prompts: hung12 ‚Üí newpass123

# Option B: Quick
cd StaffSphere1/backend
python quick_reset_password.py hung12 newpass123

# Option C: API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3200/api/auth/reset-password \

  -d '{"username":"hung12","new_password":"newpass123"}'
```

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

1. **Admin Reset** (`/auth/reset-password`):
   - No authentication required currently
   - Use carefully - anyone who can call this API can reset passwords
   - **Recommendation**: Add admin authentication in production

2. **User Change** (`/auth/change-password`):
   - Requires current password
   - Safe for users to change their own passwords
   - Cannot change other users' passwords

3. **Password Requirements**:
   - Minimum 4 characters (enforced in script)
   - No maximum length
   - **Recommendation**: Add stronger requirements in production

### üîê **After Password Reset**

1. ‚úÖ Password is immediately hashed and stored
2. ‚úÖ User can login with new password
3. ‚úÖ Old password no longer works
4. ‚úÖ No manual file editing needed
5. ‚úÖ Encrypted data remains accessible (uses same password for both auth and data encryption)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important for Encrypted Data**

**If you reset a user's password, they may lose access to their encrypted employee/payroll data!**

Why? Because:
- Employee data is encrypted with **user's password**
- If password changes, old encrypted data cannot be decrypted
- **Data will be lost** unless re-encrypted

**Solution**: Before resetting password, you might want to:
1. Export user's data (while they can still login)
2. Reset password
3. Re-import data with new password

Or implement a proper password change flow that re-encrypts data.

## Example Usage

### Change Hung Nguyen's Password from "babykute" to "SecurePass2024"

```bash
cd StaffSphere1/backend
python quick_reset_password.py hung12 SecurePass2024
```

**Output**:
```
Resetting password for user: hung12
[OK] Password reset for user: hung12
[SUCCESS] Password successfully reset for user 'hung12'
User 'hung12' can now login with the new password.
```

**Verification**:
```bash
# Try to login with new password via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3200/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"hung12","password":"SecurePass2024"}'
```

## Summary

| Method | Best For | Authentication | Notes |
|--------|---------|----------------|-------|
| Interactive Script | Admin, careful changes | None | Lists all users, confirms action |
| Quick Script | Admin, fast changes | None | One command, instant reset |
| API Reset | Automation, scripts | None (‚ö†Ô∏è secure this!) | No verification needed |
| API Change | User self-service | Requires old password | Secure, user can change own |
